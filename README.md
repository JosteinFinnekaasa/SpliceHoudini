# OpenSpliceHoudini

Open source version of Fabric Splice for SideFx Houdini
Only tested on OSX for now (but should work on Linux too).

For access to the Fabric 2.0 Beta, youâ€™ll want to sign up to this group:

# Required applications and libraries

You will need Houdini, Fabric 2.0 and FabricUI

OpenSpliceHoudini.0.4.0 is tested using:
* Houdini 14.0.223
* FabricEngine 2.0 build "FabricEngine-pablo-Darwin-x86_64-20150513-150126"
* FabricUI commit number "91e27ea1f8124f1b95bd74cab7defa099dadddd1"

I'm assuming both FabricEngine-2.0 and FabricUI are copied under a FABRIC_PARENT_DIR directory.
You will need Qt 4.8 to build FabricUI.

# TEMPORARY

You will need to add additional DCC methods from SpliceHoudini/Ext/SpliceHoudiniUtils.kl into your FabricEngine-2.0/Exts/Builtin/Geometry/PolygonMesh/PolygonMeshDCCConversion.kl.
This is a very temporary thing until similar methods are distributed with Fabric 2.0!

# Environment setup

Launch Houdini shell to get the Houdini environment (on Mac, ctrl + space > Houdini Terminal)

Then run those lines:
> cd $FABRIC_PARENT_DIR/FabricEngine-2.0.0-beta-Darwin-x86_64
> source environment.sh
> export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$FABRIC_PARENT_DIR/FabricEngine-2.0.0-beta-Darwin-x86_64/lib

To build and install plugin:
> make install

To clean:
> make clean_all

# Tests

First add the SpliceHoudini DFG_Presets to your FABRIC_DFG_PATH:  
export FABRIC_DFG_PATH=$SPLICE_HOUDINI_DIR/DFG_Presets:$FABRIC_DFG_PATH
Then from your SpliceHoudini directory run: 
> cd test; hython loadScenes.py ; cd -

Once tests are running well, you can start playing in Houdini !
