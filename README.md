# OpenSpliceHoudini

Open source version of Fabric Splice for SideFx Houdini

Here is a short video showing it in action: https://vimeo.com/127362431

Build system for OSX and Linux. Fell free to contribute for the Windows build :)

For access to the Fabric 2.0 Beta, youâ€™ll want to sign up to this group:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/fabric-engine-beta

From there you can download Fabric 2.0 and clone/build FabricUI.

# Required applications and libraries

You will need Houdini, Fabric 2.0 and FabricUI

OpenSpliceHoudini.0.4.0 is tested using:
* Houdini 14.0.223
* FabricEngine 2.0 build "FabricEngine-pablo-Darwin-x86_64-20150514-182019"
* FabricUI commit number "d84cc214d9f0cb6cba874be427e06bb8d8c7c2c0"

I'm assuming both FabricEngine-2.0 and FabricUI are copied under a FABRIC_PARENT_DIR directory.
You will need Qt 4.8 to build FabricUI.

# Environment setup

Launch Houdini shell to get the Houdini environment (on Mac, ctrl + space > Houdini Terminal)

Then source Fabric2.0 (already done if you just build FabricUI) and SpliceHoudini environments:
'''
> cd $FABRIC_PARENT_DIR/FabricEngine-pablo-Darwin-x86_64-20150514-182019
> source environment.sh
> cd $FABRIC_PARENT_DIR/SpliceHoudini
> source environment.sh
'''

To build and install plugin:
> make install

To clean:
> make clean_all

# Tests

From your SpliceHoudini directory run:
'''
> cd test; hython loadScenes.py ; cd -
'''

Once tests are running well, you can start playing in Houdini !
